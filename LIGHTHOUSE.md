## What's been tested?

I have tested all webpages that are accessible by the user. Below are images showcasing the results of each test done for each page.

### Homepage

This is the first page that each user will see when they load the webpage. I have done 2 tests for this page, 1 for logged in and 1 for logged out.

### Create a post

Creating posts has just 1 test, since only users that are logged in can access this page

![Create a post](/static/images/gamers-unite-create-a-post-lighthouse.png)

[Back to contents](#contents)   
[Back to Lighthouse testing README.md](/README.md#lighthouse-testing)

### Edit a post

Editing posts also has just 1 test, as only the user that created the post can access the specific post to be edited

[Back to Lighthouse testing README.md](/README.md#lighthouse-testing)

### View a post

I have done 2 tests for viewing a post, as any visitor can view a post

[Back to Lighthouse testing README.md](/README.md#lighthouse-testing)

#### Logged in

### Edit comment

I have done only 1 test for editing comments, since only the user that created the specified comment can edit the comment

![Edit comment](/static/images/gamers-unite-edit-comment-lighthouse.png)

[Back to Lighthouse testing README.md](/README.md#lighthouse-testing)

### Login page

Any user can access the login page, so I have therefore only done a single test for this page

[Back to Lighthouse testing README.md](/README.md#lighthouse-testing)

### Logout page

Any logged in user can logout whenever they wish, so there is only 1 test for this page too

![Logout](/static/images/gamers-unite-logout-lighthouse.png)

### Signup page

Any user can access the signup page, therefore there's only 1 test for this page once again
